## 📘 Problem Description

Implement a **First-In-First-Out (FIFO) Queue** using only standard stack operations.  
You must implement the following methods:

- `void push(int x)` – Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
- `int pop()` – Removes and returns the element at the front of the queue.
- `int peek()` – Returns the element at the front of the queue.
- `bool empty()` – Returns true if the queue is empty.

**Constraints**:
- Only standard stack operations are allowed: push, pop, top/peek, empty.
- Amortized O(1) time per operation is required.
